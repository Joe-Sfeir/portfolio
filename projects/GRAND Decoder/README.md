# GRAND Decoding Algorithm - Project Summary

This project involved the implementation of a 5-stage pipelined GRAND soft-decoder in RISC-V assembly.

**Key Achievements:**
- Engineered a confidence-vector mechanism that improved decoding accuracy by ~8%.
- Reduced clock cycles by 12% compared to the baseline implementation.
