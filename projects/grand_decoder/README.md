# GRAND Decoding Algorithm - Project Summary

This project presents the design, implementation, and optimisation of a Guessing Random
Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) algorithm written entirely in RISC-V assembly.
Starting from a simple linear decoder, we introduced a five-stage pipeline and finally a 
soft-decoding mechanism driven by a confidence vector. Performance (clock cycles) and accuracy
were measured at each iteration.
